This Jekyll Project Page Starter Kit is a starting point for creating project pages hosted on GitHub Pages. It is very opinionated and made for [myslef](https://twitter.com/_kevinatari), currently used for the [vhost project](http://kevingimbel.com/vhost). You can, however, fork it or get inspired by this skeleton to create your own version.
